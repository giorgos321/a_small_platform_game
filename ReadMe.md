# Project Title

This is a small platform game using Python 3.7 and Pygame library

## Getting Started

Clone the repo to the folder of your choice

### Prerequisites

You need to have Python installed (of course :P) but not version 3.8 because pygame has some issues with that version.
Next step is to install pygame. So in your root directory do :
```
pip install pygame
```
OR
```
pip3 install pygame
```

### Running

After that run the main.py and the game will start playing

```
python3 main.py
```
If you are using powershell:
```
py main.py
```
